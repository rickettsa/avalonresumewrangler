               <Description>
                  <p>Trey worked on the development and design of a near real-time communication ingestion and search application on top of HDP 2.2. The application required extensive use of Kafka, Storm, Solr, and HBase to meet the SLAs for the project. The cluster, secured with Kerberos, actively ingested multiple types of communication data from different sources and made them searchable within five minutes. The architecture provided an extensible approach to near real-time ingestion of data and the ability to search across the data set seamlessly as it grows.</p>
