               <Title>Team lead/Architect/Senior Developer</Title>
               <OrganizationName>McKesson</OrganizationName>
               <Description>
                  <p>As a team lead/ senior developer and architect, Mr. Devadoss has worked on multiple projects using technologies like Java, VCM, Vignette Portal, jQuery. Some of his tasks include:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Optimizing the cost associated
                with the alerting mechanism. The alerting mechanism
                in the portal refreshes every 5 minutes to bring
                the up to date alerts to the end users. Per the
                previous implementation, it was costing $250,000
                per annum for the client. The new design
                implemented by Mr. Devadoss' team cut down the
                total cost, and provided a significant savings to
                the client.</li>
                     <li>Identified and implemented the fix
                for rebates functionality, which was the major
                cause for the slowness in the portal.</li>
                     <li>Designed and implemented dashboard
                functionality in portal for the customers to view
                several metrics including their purchase history,
                returns %, etc.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Designed the remove stale users
                functionality within the portal, which divides the
                users into 6 segments, based on their last login
                date and either send notifications reminding them
                to login or deleting the users from the system if
                they have not logged in the portal for more than 9
                months.</li>
                     <li>Designed and developed custom
                permissioning for the portal in addition to the out
                of the box Vignette Portal permissions.</li>
                     <li>Designed and lead the team on
                creating a new functionality that led the admins to
                create bulk users on the fly thereby saving a lot
                of time for the portal admins.</li>
                     <li>Designed and developed a new flow
                in the content publishing process wherein the
                content authors can skip the normal workflow and
                directly publish a particular content item.</li>
                     <li>Developed the click to order
                functionality inside the portal.</li>
