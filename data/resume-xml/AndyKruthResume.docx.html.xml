                  <p>InsideSales.com offers the sales industry's first comprehensive sales acceleration platform that creates high-performance sales teams with breakthrough technology.</p>
                  <p>Andy spent time with members of every step of InsideSales development process to consult on the efficiency and optimization of a new system meant to predict optimal potential sales connections.</p>
                  <p>Andy advised InsideSales on how to properly create a physical infrastructure for HDP, administer an appropriate level of security features, and did basic training of administrators on how to administer the cluster in Ambari. He also spent a lot of time with the analytical team advising on best design and implementation practices for complex HBase systems including HBase Schema design, data creation and retrieval, and how to best integrate with the custom Yarn applications they were developing.</p>

               <Description>
                  <p>Bell is an industry leading helicopter company recognized globally for their state-of-the-art products and services.</p>
                  <p>Andy architected and developed a solution to ingest flight time data, process it, and create valuable statistics. The system used a complex ETL process to read through the flight data using Python and produce valuable regime statistics and analytical aggregates. The statistics and aggregates were stored in HDP for batch analytical querying using Pig and Hive, as well as the raw data for retrospective reference and processing.</p>

               <OrganizationName>Dell Computers, INC.</OrganizationName>
               <Description>
                  <p>Dell is an industry leading hardware product company known for desktops, laptops, storage, servers, and consumer electronics sold world-wide.</p>
                  <p>Andy architected and developed a pilot infrastructure to ingest several types of machine and structured data into an HDP environment. The solution supported batch analytics through custom Java MapReduce and Hive, with near real-time alerting and viewing through HBase, Kafka, and Storm. This pilot helped Dell gain insight on how they could save money and complexity by switching their current data storage model to an HDP solution. It also provided a querying interface to do previously unattainable historical and batch analytics.</p>
                  <p>Andy was responsible for architecting an ingestion pipeline that preprocessed data in Python and stored partition data in HDP. The data was then cleaned and consolidated for concise querying using Custom MapReduce and Hive.</p>
                  <p>For the real-time strategy Andy helped develop a solution that would process and alert using Kafka and Storm for real time ingestion. The alerts and data viewing were handled using websockets and a java HBase Client to view data immediately throughout the ingestion process from a custom web app.</p>

This project would enable Triad to store previously disposable data and start to implement predictive analytics to better target their ad campaigns.</p>
