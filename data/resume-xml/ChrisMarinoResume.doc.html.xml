               <Description>
                  <p>Fairfax County, the Washington metropolitan area's largest county, with a population of about 1 million people, has developed a repository for land use data that will make it easier for county employees, land developers and residents to access real-time information about zoning changes, county land ordinances and property history.</p>
                  <p>The land data repository, based on the MarkLogic 5 database, will boost the productivity of county employees who have to search through multiple databases to find pertinent information and give residents, who now have to search through a plethora of websites for home history data, a single website to access information, according to a Fairfax County IT executive.</p>
                  <p>Chris worked as a consultant on the project helping the county develop a solution to convert over 500 content sources into the MarkLogic repository. In his role, Chris:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Analyzed the data related to
                Mainframe and Relational Databases to ingest them
                into MarkLogic</li>
                     <li>Used MarkLogic data tools like
                RecordLoad, Corb, and XQSync to load and process
                the data</li>
